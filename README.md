## notes
* lots of code was taken from my other project lazy-eye-blocks TODO

## TODOs
* write this readme
* provide good html template with pug
* scan for TODOs during production build
* adjust .gitignore, remove unnecessary entries
* theme coloring fix, pull out common patterns
* disable parcel cache?
* make sure that dist folder is being cleaned every time by parcel
* transpile to es6 only, no need for es5 I think
* move components folder to utils folder
* continue button
